# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Project Introduction
Everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, color or geographic area, enjoys movies. Through this incredible medium, we are all connected in some manner. What's most intriguing, however, is how unique our movie likes and combinations are. Some people prefer genre films, such as thrillers, romance, or science fiction, while others are more interested in the leading stars and filmmakers. With all of this in mind, it's quite impossible to generalize a film and declare that everyone will enjoy it. Despite this, it is clear that similar films are enjoyed by a specific segment of the population. So this is where we, as a data scientiest, come in to extract the juice from all of the audience's and movie's behavorial patterns

# Filtration Strategy
In this movie recommendation system project, we are using content-based filtering combined with populatiry-based filtering to build our machine learning model (recommendation system)
